## Preface
I'm currently sitting on a step ladder, my room is bare outside of scattered paint cans and supplies. Maybe it's the fumes of paint, but as I sit here I have the inclination to pull out my Macbook and start writing a blog post. I want to write a summary of the last few years with a focus on 2020 and what's in store for 2021. 

## Getting Caught Up
I guess I want to rewind to 2010, I just started finished High School and started University. I went in with the idea that I wanted to be a doctor, to help people. For the longest time, I pushed myself for that. I remember nights staying up stressing about it. It consumed me. At first, it was excitement, a feeling of knowing I could change people's lives. Years passed and the excitement faded. It started to become nights wondering if I'd get in, am I competitive enough, and constant studying in between. By Summer 2016 I was prepping for the MCAT and was miserable. It felt like a chore more than anything else. 

Eventually, test day came, as I made my way through the test I would constantly stop and think, "Do you really want this". By the end of the test, the answer was no. I do admit as time passed I occasionally did get the urge to apply to med schools, but ultimately I moved on.

So 2017 comes and I graduate with a degree in Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Biology. I had been working in the Associate Dean of Science's lab during the year and had realized research also wasn't for me. I found lab research to be slow, repetitive, and labs to be depressing to be in round the clock. With that in mind, I decided to apply for a Masters Degree wasn't for me. Early into my time as a researcher, I noticed that the work I was doing was being analyzed by computers. It got me thinking about how the worked. Next thing I know I'm taking an Intro to Computer Science class the semester before graduating.

## Computer Science
The first Intro to Computer Science class I took was exhausting. It was a whole different paradigm, I struggled a lot. I had to put in more effort than ever to pull out an A. But through all of the growing pains, I enjoyed it. I ended up graduating and applying immediately for a second degree. That summer I took the second Intro to CS class. I had taken all of the other prerequisites for the  CS program at my school, like Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Stats in my last degree so I was granted entry directly into the second year.

After picking up the fundamentals of programming the second year wasn't too bad, it was filled with a mix of programming and mathematical theory. I also made a lot of good friends during my time here through the Computer Science Students' Association. By the time I was done my second year, I applied to the CS Co-Op program at my school and was fortunate to get in. This allowed me to do alternate between full-time jobs interning and school.

I got to intern at some of the coolest places, the National Microbiology Laboratory allowed me to use both my degrees to create tools that look at viral mutations. My second internship at Bold Commerce allowed me to work on Shopify apps. Both were amazing experiences where I not only built things to help others, but I made a lot of wonderful friends. 

By the end of my third year of CS, I decided to run for President of the Computer Science Students' Association, I would end up winning the election and had a blast in my last year of CS representing the students! We were able to throw some great events like a Game Jam (game hackathon), A back to school mixer, and board game nights. I also was able to represent the students during faculty only meetings as the student rep. Advocating for students was rad.

Unfortunately, COVID hit and my last internship that was planned for Summer 2020 never happened. Thankfully, the Federal Government of Canada reached out to me in May asking to help with COVID support at the Centre for Biosecurity. I ended up spending the entire Summer and fall working full time there. In the fall I also attended school full time, finishing my degree requirements. I wanted to do one last internship before joining any company as a full-time software engineer/developer. I was fortunate enough to interview with a tech startup here in Winnipeg and had an offer in under 4 hours! I'll be starting that next week and super excited.

## 2020

Honestly, it's been hard. While I was fortunate to get a job during the Summer and Fall, the time after tech internships dried up had me stressing. While I may not contribute a lot, I do try to help my family as much as possible. It hurt knowing I couldn't do that. It was a huge stressor for a few weeks (This was before the Fed gov was giving students 1250 a month). Things got better after I was employed again. I loved the work I did at the Centre for Biosecurity, it was rewarding helping with the COVID pandemic. 

Working from home was a different story. Working as a Software Developer has its perks, like the ability to work from home. The times I've done it in the past were great. I thought I'd feel the same working for the Centre of Biosecurity. I did at first. I loved not having to drive, the ability to roll out of my bed, but as time passed it got annoying. I hated being in my room for 8 hours a day. Then September came and I also attending school full time. I'd do 8 hours of work, use my lunch breaks to attend the odd lecture that wasn't pre-recorded, then start watching the pre-recorded lectures, do assignments, and study once work ended. By early December I was burned out. 

Right now I have nothing going on, my work contract with Biosecurity ended, I'm done school, and I'm chilling until my internship starts. Honestly, this has been so nice. 

I am sick of my room though, after being in it 24/7 I can't wait to get vaccinated and start traveling once it's safe! I want to go to NYC :), go to a Heat game, hike Yellowstone National Park, do a gondola ride in Italy, and so much more. COVID has made me really appreciate trips much more.

In the meantime, I'm redoing my room. I got sick of how it looked. I'm currently painting it, setting up a new desk, and reorienting my bed. It'll be different and hopefully much nicer to work in.


## 2021

I've been thinking a lot about 2021 and what my goals and resolutions are. Honestly, helping others. Whether I can mentor students, donate money to charity, volunteer at a women's shelter, or something else. I want to make a change in the lives of others. Be it, one person or multiple people. I'd like to also start a Scholarship Fund for people pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Biology. I'd like to help people who need financial assistance attend school.

On a professional level, I'm excited to intern until April then move onto a full-time salaried contract. My ultimate goal in tech is to join a leadership position and lead a team. I love teaching and helping others reach their potential. 

Lots of cooking too, I want to do more Pakistani cooking! Another hobby I want to explore more is making TikToks. My room renovation will leave me with a lot of extra room to do TikTok dances (... I actually make tech videos occasionally lol).

I'm also keen on getting into my best physical shape! Might touch on that more later :).

## Closing


I probably forgot to mention things of importance, but this is getting long. Going to stop writing, post this, and then get back to painting :).

### TLDR:
I finished a CS degree in 3 years, cooked food, and excited to help others in 2021 while growing as a tech professional. Did I mention I love my family and friends... because I do :).


Have a wonderful NYE and 2021,

Ahmed
