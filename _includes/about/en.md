> It’s not so much what we have in this life that matters. It’s what we do with what we have. - Fred Rogers

Hiya,

Some people may know me as the guy with a background in biology and computer science, to others I may be the guy who loves posting pics of the food he makes, maybe you've seen my TikToks. However, first and foremost I'm Ahmed the person who loves his family and friends :).

My current career is working as a Software Engineer. My goals are to create software that helps humanity. In the past, I've worked on [viral analysis tools](https://github.com/phac-nml/quasitools) for the National Microbiology Laboratory of Canada. I've also interned at Bold Commerce where I helped develop the top-rated [Discount App](https://apps.shopify.com/product-discount) on the Shopify platform. In January I will be interning as a Software Developer at Upfeat Media.

Outside of the professional realm, I love cooking. Specifically, I love cooking for my family and friends! I find cooking to be really therapeutic, it reminds me of a more forgiving version of chemistry labs. It also fills my heart with a lot of joy when others enjoy the food I make. When I'm not cooking I like trying new hobbies. Currently, I'm getting into content creation on TikTok.

As for this website, I made it primarily to host my thoughts. I'll be posting everything from nerdy science posts, recipes, fashion, sports, all the way to self-reflections. Basically, anything is fair game.
